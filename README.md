# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The CEO of a fictonal ride sharing company named PyBer asked for help  them for the following data: 

1. Create a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. Create a multiple line chart of total fare for each city type
3. Write a report for the analysis

## Resources
The CEO provided complete rider and driver PyBer company data in two CSV files. My approach was to use Jupyter Notebooks to write Python script that read the ride and driver data, __________, then created and saved a PNG image of the multiple line chart to easily share my results.
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebooks 6.4.8
- Language: Python 3.7.13
- Packages: Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot
